# An intelligent System to predict the disease of an affected crop/plant

As the farmer's population is enormous in our country, it is very hard for an 
agricultural scientist to suggest and help each farmer individually. This 
project aims to provide an easy and effective way for farmers to predict the 
disease of an affected crop. The farmer should take a photograph of the 
diseased crop and upload it. Disease prediction should be done automatically 
with the experts/scientists opinion facility and, provide appropriate 
suggestions to the farmers.
